Subject: MPW Inquiry - 81-Trit Ternary Optical Processor (v1.2 Simplified Architecture)

---

Hello,

I'm an independent researcher developing a ternary optical computing architecture that uses wavelength-division multiplexing for arithmetic operations. I'm interested in fabricating a proof-of-concept chip through your MPW program.

*Project summary:*

The design is an 81-trit optical ALU that encodes ternary logic states (-1, 0, +1) as three wavelengths. Arithmetic operations are performed via sum-frequency generation in a χ² nonlinear waveguide. The architecture is documented in a peer-reviewed publication on Zenodo (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18437600).

*Design details (v1.2 - Simplified AWG-based output architecture):*

- Die size estimate: ~3.6 × 5.4 mm (full 81-trit), smaller single-ALU test structures available
- Waveguide width: 0.5 μm (single-mode), mixer width: 0.8 μm
- 5-detector carry propagation for full arithmetic capability

*Optimized wavelengths:*
- Input: 1.550 μm (C-band), 1.216 μm (O-band adjacent), 1.000 μm (near-IR)
- Output (SFG): 0.775, 0.681, 0.608, 0.549, 0.500 μm

*Component counts (81-trit chip):*
- 486 ring resonators (input selectors)
- 243 AWG demultiplexers (2 input + 1 output per ALU)
- 81 SFG mixers (χ² nonlinear)
- 405 photodetectors (5 per ALU for carry propagation)
- ~500 MMI couplers

*Key optimization:* The v1.2 architecture uses AWG demultiplexers for output wavelength separation instead of ring resonator filters, reducing component count by 45% per ALU while maintaining full functionality.

- Generated with gdsfactory (generic PDK - ready for layer mapping)

*Questions:*

1. Is your platform compatible with this design? Specifically:
   - Waveguide core index ~2.2 (LiNbO3 or high-index SiN)
   - χ² nonlinear mixing capability (or can I bond/deposit nonlinear material?)
   - Wavelength range support: 0.5-1.55 μm

2. What are your current MPW schedules and pricing for a design of this size?

3. What PDK and design rules should I use to regenerate the layout for your process?

4. Do you offer design review services before tape-out?

I have a complete design summary, GDS file, and simulation data ready to share. All SFG output wavelengths have been verified by Meep FDTD simulation. The full project repository is public: https://github.com/jackwayne234/-wavelength-ternary-optical-computer

Thank you for your time. I look forward to hearing from you.

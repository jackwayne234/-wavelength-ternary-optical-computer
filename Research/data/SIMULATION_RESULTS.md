# DIY Polymer Waveguide Simulation Results

**Date**: February 1, 2026
**Purpose**: Evaluate feasibility of DIY-accessible materials for Phase 4 optical chip fabrication

## Summary

These simulations compare LiNbO3 (requires HF etching) against polymer alternatives that can be fabricated with standard lithography or laser ablation.

### Key Findings

1. **Passive components (routing, splitting, wavelength selection)**: Polymers work excellently
2. **Nonlinear mixing (SFG)**: Poled polymers achieve 5-15% of LiNbO3 efficiency - sufficient for proof-of-concept
3. **KDP crystals**: Not viable due to low χ² and phase mismatch issues

## Simulation 1: Ring Resonator Wavelength Selector

**File**: `polymer_selector_comparison.png`
**Script**: `../programs/polymer_selector.py`
**Log**: `polymer_selector_log.txt`

Tests whether polymer waveguides can perform wavelength selection (filtering RGB channels).

### Results

| Material | n_core | Index Contrast | Ring Radius | Fits 12" Chip? |
|----------|--------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| LiNbO3 / Air | 2.20 | 1.200 | 0.8 μm | Yes (199,171 rings) |
| SU-8 / Air | 1.57 | 0.570 | 3.2 μm | Yes (48,292 rings) |
| PMMA / Air | 1.49 | 0.490 | 4.4 μm | Yes (34,496 rings) |
| Poled DR1-PMMA / Air | 1.50 | 0.500 | 4.4 μm | Yes (34,711 rings) |

### Conclusion

All polymer materials produce functional ring resonators. Lower refractive index contrast requires larger ring radii, but this is trivial at 12" chip scale. **Passive routing is fully feasible with DIY polymers.**

## Simulation 2: SFG Material Comparison

**File**: `polymer_sfg_comparison.png` (partial - DAST simulation interrupted)
**Script**: `../programs/polymer_sfg_comparison.py`
**Log**: `polymer_sfg_comparison_log.txt`

Tests sum-frequency generation (nonlinear mixing) efficiency across materials.

### Results

| Material | χ² (pm/V) | SFG Signal | DIY Feasible? | Relative to LiNbO3 |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| LiNbO3 (baseline) | 30.0 | 3.63e-01 | No (requires HF) | 100% |
| DR1-SU8 (poled) | 30.0 | 5.36e-02 | Yes | **15%** |
| DR1-PMMA (poled) | 35.0 | 1.87e-02 | Yes | **5%** |
| KDP crystal | 0.39 | 1.26e-03 | Yes | 0.3% |
| DAST | 290.0 | (not completed) | No (hard to grow) | N/A |

### Conclusion

**Poled polymers (DR1-doped SU-8 or PMMA) are the best DIY option for nonlinear mixing.** They achieve 5-15% of LiNbO3 efficiency, which is detectable and sufficient for proof-of-concept demonstration.

## Simulation 3: KDP Length Scaling

**File**: `kdp_length_scaling.png`
**Script**: `../programs/polymer_sfg_comparison.py --kdp-scaling`
**Log**: `kdp_scaling_log.txt`

Tests whether longer KDP waveguides can compensate for low χ² coefficient.

### Results

| KDP Length | SFG Signal | Relative to LiNbO3 @ 20μm |
|------------|------------|---------------------------|
| 20 μm | 1.26e-03 | 0.35% |
| 50 μm | 2.89e-03 | 0.80% |
| 100 μm | 3.02e-03 | 0.83% |
| 200 μm | 6.56e-04 | 0.18% |

### Conclusion

**KDP cannot compete with LiNbO3 or poled polymers.** The SFG signal initially increases with length but then drops at 200μm due to phase mismatch. Without quasi-phase matching (periodic poling), the generated signal oscillates and cancels out. Even at optimal length, KDP achieves less than 1% of LiNbO3 efficiency.

## Recommended DIY Phase 4 Approach

Based on these simulations:

1. **Waveguide routing**: SU-8 ridge waveguides with air cladding
   - No etching required (SU-8 IS the waveguide)
   - Pattern with DLP UV lithography or direct laser write

2. **Nonlinear mixer**: DR1-doped SU-8 with electric field poling
   - Dope SU-8 with Disperse Red 1 chromophore before spin coating
   - Build poling apparatus: heating stage (100-150°C) + HV electrodes (50-100 V/μm)
   - Expected efficiency: ~15% of LiNbO3

3. **Skip KDP**: Despite being easy to grow, the low χ² makes it impractical

4. **Avoid HF entirely**: The polymer approach eliminates the most dangerous chemical in the original Phase 4 plan
